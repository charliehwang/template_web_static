# Template for a Static Web App

Use this as a starting point for a small local web app.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/charliehwang/template_web_static.git
npm i
```

The html template is located in "./src/index.html"

All other source files are located also in the same "./src" directory.

You can run the Development Server. It reloads the webpage so you can see HTML/JS/CSS changes as you save.

```
npm run devserver
```
