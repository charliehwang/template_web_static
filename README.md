# Template for a Static Web App

Use this as a starting point for a local file web app. The html template is located in "./src/index.html". JS/SCSS and test files are also located also in the same "./src" directory.

## Getting Started

Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/charliehwang/template_web_static.git
```

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

You can run the Development Server like so:

```
npm run devserver
```

It reloads the webpage so you can see HTML/JS/CSS changes as you save.
